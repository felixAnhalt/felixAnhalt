# Welcome

Hey, I’m Felix Anhalt — Senior Fullstack Engineer.

At my first job I was born into the world of business process automation in Java with camunda BPM.
At my second, the journey broadened into Frontend (React, Remix, Next), node (everything in TS) and now lots of python.
I like code that's self-explanatory and suffices for all the -illities you can think of, mostly maintainability and readability tho.

## Areas I Work In/Worked in recently
*	LLM-driven workflows and automation.
*	Fullstack apps, end-to-end.
*	Architecture templates for our Frontend and backend projects 

## Principles I Build By
*	Practicality First: Get it working first, then polish.
*	Technology is a tool, not a religion. LLMs as well.
*	Code is for people first, machines second.
*   Simplicity > Complexity
