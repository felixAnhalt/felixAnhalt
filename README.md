# 👋 Welcome

Hey, I’m Felix Anhalt — Senior Fullstack Engineer.

I specialize in building high-performance, scalable, and clean systems using Node.js, React.js, Remix.js (all with TS) and Python.
I believe in code that speaks for itself, systems that heal themselves, and solutions that survive real-world chaos.

## 🛠️ Areas I Work In
*	LLM-driven workflows and automation.
*	Fullstack apps, end-to-end.
*	Architecture Blueprints: Clean, modular, and future-proof designs — no overengineering.

## 🧠 Principles I Build By
*	Practicality First: Get it working first, then polish.
*	Innovate With Purpose: Technology is a tool, not a religion.
*	Keep It Human: Simple is powerful. Code is for people first, machines second.
*   Simplicity > Complexity: Always choose the simplest solution that works.
